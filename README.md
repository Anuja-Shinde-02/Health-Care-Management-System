# Health-Care-Management-System

## Background
Due to today's fast-paced lifestyle, people are constantly on the move, whether they are moving
or traveling. This makes it challenging for them to retain and carry physical medical records,
which prevents them from receiving the best healthcare. In this approach, the diagnosis-treatment
process can be accelerated and made more effective for hospitals, doctors, and patients by
enabling remote and on-demand access to patient information.


## Aim
"To provide the most effective and flexible access to healthcare records using database
management systems in order to inspire and contribute to health and well-being."


## Objectives
1. Every hospital and clinician in the globe will have access to all patient data (including
previous medical records) through a centralized system.
2. In addition to the necessity for physical medical records being eliminated, patients would
still have access to their records.
3. Using a passport-linked unique identifier to gain access to a patient's medical records.
4. Doctors have rapid access to a patient's medical history in urgent situations.
5. In the event of an emergency, the emergency contact should be informed.
