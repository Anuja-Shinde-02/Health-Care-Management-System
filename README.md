# Health-Care-Management-System

## Background
Due to today's fast-paced lifestyle, people are constantly on the move, whether moving
or traveling. This makes it challenging for them to retain and carry physical medical records,
which prevents them from receiving the best healthcare. In this approach, the diagnosis-treatment
the process can be accelerated and made more effective for hospitals, doctors, and patients by
enabling remote and on-demand access to patient information.


## Aim
"To provide the most effective and flexible access to healthcare records using database
management systems to inspire and contribute to health and well-being."


## Objectives
1. Every hospital and clinician globally will have access to all patient data (including
previous medical records) through a centralized system.
2. In addition to the necessity for physical medical records to be eliminated, patients would
still have access to their records.
3. Using a passport-linked unique identifier to access a patient's medical records.
4. Doctors have rapid access to a patient's medical history in urgent situations.
5. In the event of an emergency, the emergency contact should be informed.

## Business Problem
1. Patient medical records are stored in physical files, creating challenges for patients to
store and maintain all records.
2. Neither the patient nor the doctor can access the patient's records when moving
home (or even for a short trip). Because we can't physically carry all the files, including
medical records.
3. Patient medical records are stored in physical files, so in the event of an emergency,
doctors do not have sufficient information about a patient's past medical records.
